## Node.js Server Description

This Node.js server is a lightweight and efficient backend application designed to handle HTTP requests and responses. The server is built using the `http` module, which is part of Node.js's core modules, and it listens for incoming requests on a custom-defined port.

### Features
1. **Custom Port Configuration**:
   - The server allows you to specify your own port for listening to client requests.
   - This ensures flexibility and compatibility with various environments.

2. **Request Handling**:
   - The server processes HTTP requests and responds with appropriate messages or data.
   - It supports different HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

3. **Scalability**:
   - As the server is built using Node.js, it uses a non-blocking, event-driven architecture, making it highly scalable for real-time applications.

### How It Works
1. The `http` module is used to create the server.
2. The server listens on a specified port (defaulting to `3000` if not explicitly set).
3. When a request is received, the server handles it by parsing the URL and HTTP method, responding with relevant information.

### Example Code
```javascript
const http = require('http');

// Define the port
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// Create the server
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
  res.end('Welcome to my Node.js server!');
});

// Start listening on the port
server.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

### Usage
- Start the server using:
  ```bash
  node server.js
  ```
- Access it in your browser or via tools like Postman using:
  ```
  http://localhost:<your-port>
  ```

This server forms the foundation for building more complex backend services and APIs!
